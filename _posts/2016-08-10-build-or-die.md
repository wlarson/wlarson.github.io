I have been thinking about my last position at Amazon for a while now.  I had a promising career there for eight years, steadily moving up the ranks while receiving stellar feedback.  But I struggled after moving into a software development manager role my last two years.

It always bothered me that software development teams were rewarded more for launching new services than improving existing ones.   I have written plenty of code from scratch, but the majority of my industry experience is maintaining and extending existing software.  And at a company like Amazon there is a lot of existing software.

I thought I was doing a good job, but recent annual reviews did not back it up.  For the first time my reviews indicated a backwards slide, despite delivering several high profile projects that eluded my predecessors.  Looking back, my big projects were focused on extending or deprecating legacy systems.  My team built a few new services, but there were six more teams involved in replacing our legacy systems.  Most of those teams were 100% focused on building, while my team had an 80/20 split of old vs new.

Nine months before quitting, an organizational change moved my team to an operations org.  My responsibilities did not change, just the management chain above me.  At the time I felt taken for granted.  I can see now they were trying to put me in a better position to succeed, where my values were in sync with my organization.

One of my big lessons learned is that software development leveling guidelines, used for annual reviews and promotions, strongly favor building new systems over maintaining existing ones.  So while I may not like the fact that new development is valued more than sustaining development,  it is a conscious and transparent decision by the company.  To get promoted beyond a level two developer, SDE II in Amazon speak, you have to successfully design, build, and launch a service with significant business benefit.

Deprecating old systems may be valued, but it's more project management than software development.  Building the new that replaces the old, however, is what people are looking for.  That said... replacement systems should be significantly and measurably better.  Re-invented wheels are a waste, leveling docs be damned.
