Early in my career I received a great piece of advice:  work yourself out of a job.  If you can successfully eliminate the need for your current role, there are many other roles in need of the same treatment.  

*Find problem, fix problem, repeat.*

Over the first fifteen years of my career, primarily as a software engineer, this formula worked well for me.  As a manager, however, I failed to recognize a significant change in this dynamic.  As the boss, you work your way into a job.

*Find problem, let your team fix it, repeat.*

One of the big benefits of doing this is you get to define your role.  There are lots of problems out there.  Which do you want to work on?  Meeting with potential clients, listening to their problems, and committing to solve them allows you the choice of job.

As manager your value is building teams and finding problems for them to solve.  Failure to solve problems reflects poorly on your ability to build and grow your team, not your ability to solve problems.
