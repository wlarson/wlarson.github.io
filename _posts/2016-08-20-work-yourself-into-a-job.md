Early in my career I received a great piece of advice:  work yourself out of a job.  If you can successfully eliminate the need for your current role, there are many other roles in need of the same treatment.  

*Receive problem, fix problem, repeat.*

Over the first fifteen years of my career, primarily as a software engineer, this formula worked well for me.  As a manager, however, I failed to recognize a significant change in this dynamic.  As the boss, you work your way into a job.

*Find problem, assign problem, repeat.*

One of the big benefits of doing this is you get to define your role.  There are lots of problems out there.  Which do you want to work on?  Meeting with potential clients, listening to their problems, and committing to solve them provides you the choice of work.  The manager's value is building teams and finding problems for them to solve, rather than sovling the problems themself.

Moving beyond the team manager role, you want to go beyond specific problems to more general problem areas.  Determine a high level direction and empower the team to creatively move the group forward.  Defining a standard set of success criteria, or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), will allow everyone to make good decisions on their own.

*Define direction, measure, assess.*
