I grew up playing team sports.  Basketball mostly, but also baseball and soccer.  In the last few years, however, I have started playing golf.  I have learned that golf is a great game for developing many important skills in life:

 - **Golf is social.**  You can golf with friends, business partners, or complete strangers and have meaningful conversations between shots.
 - **Golf is healthy.**  It is basically a five mile hike with a 35 lb backpack.
 - **Golf is strategic.**  You spend the vast majority of time preparing for your next shot.
 - **Golf is for all ages.**  You can play golf most or you life, unlike basketball/football/baseball/etc.
 - **Golf is really hard.**  Even the best golfers hit terrible shots.
 - **Golf is about dealing with failure.**  Golf will kick your ass repeatedly.  To enjoy golf you must accept the occasional bad shot.
 - **Golf is about living in the present.**  To succeed at golf you must have a short memory and focus on your current task.
