Swing size and speed on putts should be equal going backward and forward, like a pendulum.  This provides a smooth and steady stroke, with optimal line and distance control.  Line should be determined when setting the ball, not when standing over the ball.  Trust your initial read!

Recap of putting routine:

* Place ball marker and pick up ball
* Clean ball
* Check line from front and back of the hole
* Set ball with alignment mark on desired line
* Pick up ball marker
* Get set up and take practice swings until comfortable with swing size & speed
* Trust your line
* Focus entire attention on ball 
* Make steady pendulum swing through the ball
* Keep eyes focused on point of impact through the swing
* Hold the follow through until ball reaches the hole
