I am starting a website to do a few things:

* Work on my writing skills.
* Work on my coding skills.
* Stay current on website technologies.
* Have a professional website for my career.
* Golf will somehow find its way onto the site.  
* Maybe one day my career and golf will somehow be related.  Hey... a guy can dream.

So to kick things off I am going to try using Jekyll, a static site generator built on the Ruby programming language. I have some experience with Ruby, as well as Ruby on Rails (RoR), and find Ruby to be extremely readable.  I thought about using Rails, but it's overkill for what I want to do.  And Jekyll helps me learn something new.
