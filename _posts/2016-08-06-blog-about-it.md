I am starting a website to do a few things.  Firstly I want to work on my writing skills.  Second I want to work on my coding skills.  Third I want to stay current on website technologies.  Fourth I want a professional website for my career.  Fifth golf will somehow find its way onto the site.  And maybe one day my career and golf will somehow be related.  Hey... a guy can dream.

So to kick things off I am going to try using Jekyll, a static site generator built on the Ruby programming language. I have some experience with Ruby, as well as Ruby on Rails (RoR), and find Ruby to be extremely readable.  I thought about using Rails, but it's overkill for what I want to do.  And Jekyll helps me learn something new.

My background is primarily in backend systems and tools, but my interests are more about design.  As we progress further in the world of cloud computing, I forsee a focus on high level applications that rely on cloud based services and infrastruture for everything but their secret sauce.  Everything is becoming a service:  hosts, databases, authentication, workflows, payments, email marketing, shipping, accounting, etc.  Supporting hardware and software systems is hard.  Let someone else carry the pager and focus on what makes you you.
