I finally played Chambers Bay this week, taking advantage of October rates on a day it was 65 & sunny.  An absolutely perfect day for golf.

The course itself is definitely a challenge.  I hadn't picked up a club in a week and a half and it showed on the front nine, but I put it together on the back finishing with four pars in the last five holes.

Chambers definitely rewards knowledge of the course, with: well guarded greens, numerous large and deep bunkers, and sloped fairways that will dump seemingly good shots into the sand.  Though the bunkers are firm and well tended, so landing in the beach isn't a big deal.

The fairways and greens are firm and fast.  Keep it on the fairway and you'll roll for extra yards.  And consider putting or chipping any time you've got a line at the green.  One of my playing partners putted on from 150 yards on hole 16.

Hands down one of my favorite courses played.  Lots of variability in terms of distance, shape, slope, greens, etc.  And incredible panoramic views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains on every hole.
