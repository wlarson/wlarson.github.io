2016 was my first year playing in a golf men's club.  Looking back, the big benefits of joining were:  playing regularly, playing competetively, and playing with better golfers.

To improve at anything you need repetition.  At Amazon we would talk about mechanisms or virtuous cycles.  If you think about golf as a *mechanism*, it would be:  play golf, assess performance, address weaknesses and reinforce strengths, repeat.

After golfing with friends I evaluate performance in terms of good or bad... and then we drink beer.  When golfing competetively I evaluate perforance in terms of winning and losing.  Anytime I lose, irregardless of how well I played, I diagnose why.  It could be any number of things:  missing fairways, approach shots, pitching, chipping, bunkers, putting, focus, pressure.  Once I identify the root cause of my loss, I come up with a practice plan and execute it.  I may not win the following week, but I won't lose for the same reason.

During our end of season Seattle Cup, representing Interbay vs the other municipal clubs, I lost due to chipping (we were okay, they were great), putting (two costly three putts where I left a long lag putt 6-8 feet short), and missing fairways (1/13).  I managed to finish all square on that last round and earn half a point, but hitting just one fairway with driver... pathetic!  Each time I would research the problem, come up with a practice plan, and go grind.

Some closing numbers for the season.  I finished tied for 6th (of 80+) in the season long Interbay points race, finished 2nd in match play (B bracket), and dropped my handicap from 25.3 (March) to 20.3 (September).  Having tracked stats with Arccos, some key metrics were:  52.1% fairways, 30.3% GIR (71.2% short), 2.7% sand saves, 2.34 putts per GIR, 23.5% three putts.

Looking at those numbers, the #1 problem I want to work on over the offseason is leaving putts short.  It's clear that I'm subconsciously aiming for the front of the hole, trying to just barely roll it in.  To give it a chance, and set myself up for a tap-in second shot, I need my misses to go past the hole.
