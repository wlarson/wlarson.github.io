I'm currently grinding on two parts of my golf swing, both related to the release:  

1. swooshing the clubhead through the zone
2. shifting my low point forward

<br>
By working on these two parts of my swing, I expect to increase distance and consistency.

<!-- excerpt -->

The first, swooshing, increases clubhead speed by letting gravity take over (rather than trying to steer, or cast, the club through the impact zone).  Here's a video that describes swooshing and why it's important in the golf swing.

The second, shifting my low point forward, increases consistency by reducing fat shots and increases distance by delofting the club and compressing the ball.  Another video, this time from Adam Young.
