*Golf is social.*  You can do it with friends or business partners and have meaningful conversations between shots.  *Golf is competitive.*  You play against yourself and the course, yes, but you can also play matches or tournaments.  *Golf is healthy.*  It's basically a five mile hike with a 35 lb backpack.  *Golf is for all ages.*  Golf is the only sport I know that you can play at a high level for most of your life.  *Golf is really hard.*  Hitting that little ball straight is surprisingly difficult. Â And it feels so good when you hit it pure.
