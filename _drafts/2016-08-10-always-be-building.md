So you want to work in software development?  I have one piece of advise for you:  always be building.

I have been thinking about my last position at Amazon for a while now.  I had a promising career there for eight years, steadily moving up the ranks while receiving stellar feedback.  I worked in several operations groups (supply chain, customer service, catalog, finance) and was good at improving efficiency.  But I struggled after moving into a software development manager role my last two years.

It always bothered me that software development teams were rewarded more for launching new services than improving existing ones.   I should clarify that 'new service' at Amazon includes re-writing existing services.  I have written plenty of code from scratch, but the majority of my industry experience is maintaining and extending existing software.  In my experience re-writing software is wasteful, for a lot of reasons well articulated by Joel Spolsky in  [Things You Should Never Do, Part I](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html).

I thought I was doing a good job, but recent annual reviews indicated otherwise.  Looking back, my big projects were focused on extending or deprecating legacy systems.  My team built a few new services, but there were several other teams involved in replacing our legacy systems.  Those teams were 100% focused on new systems, while my team had an 80/20 split of old vs new.

One of my big lessons learned is that the software development discipline strongly favors building new systems over extending existing ones.  As Amazon likes to say:  'we let builders build.'  I may not like the fact that sustaining development is undervalued, but it is a conscious and transparent decision by the company.

Looking back, I am more fixer than builder.  I have a fifty year old car and hundred year old house.  The only things I buy new are food and clothes.  I recycle and compost, rarely throwing anything in the trash.  Add that my special sauce is relating to clients and solving their problems, not churning out code.  Long story short, I am not a builder.  I am a fixer.  And software *development* was not a good fit for me.

What about you?  Do you want to be a software developer?  Always be building.  There will be plenty of bug fixing and scaling projects along the way, but always be thinking of things to build.  Write down your ideas and share them with colleagues.  Not sure how to get started?  Find a mentor and get unblocked.  Keep doing this and you will get your chance.  Keep thinking.  Keep sharing.  Keep building.
